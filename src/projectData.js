    description: "Lush Events Website UI Design is a personal project of mine to explore my skills as a designer. It is a representation of what a user would see on an event management team's website. The focus however is on the contrasts and combination of colours, fonts and images. I have always been inspired by new ideas and different design concepts, most of which, I have tried to incorporate in my work. I have made an effort to use subtle colours and a certain hierarchy in components to keep a gentle interaction between them.",
